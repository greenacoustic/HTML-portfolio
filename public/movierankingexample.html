 <h2>A Ranking of Heather's Favorite Movies from 2024</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice</h3>
 <p>An incredible take on an iconic character. Michael Keatonâ€™s portrayal of 
 Beetlejuice is hilarious and unsettling, which is a perfect mix for this
 character.Get ready for a wild ride! </p>
 <h3>Wicked</h3>
 <p>This film beautifully captures the essence of friendship, love, and the 
complexity of identity. It brings to life the characters from the book 
beautifully and feels like the sister movie to The Wizard of Oz it was meant
to be.</p>
 <h3>Dune Part 2</h3>
 <p>This film is sensational! Possibly the greatest sequel of all time
  & a phenomenal addition to the Sci-Fi genre! </p>
